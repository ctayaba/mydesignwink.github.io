		<h2>Travel. Lifestyle. Wellness</h2>
		<p>One of the biggest challenges in my life is finding equilibrium between work, self-care, and just plain old fun. Exploring new places and challenging myself to try new things is what grounds me and sets my wild heart free. Welcome to some of my musings, both near and far.</p>

		<h2>Los Angeles Real Estate</h2>
		<p>Los Angeles Real Estate is my everyday grind. It has challenged me to go beyond what I ever thought I was capable of doing. It is truly about mindset and helping people achieve a dream. Los Angeles Real Estate is a hustle and I feel lucky to hustle in this urban paradise.</p>
