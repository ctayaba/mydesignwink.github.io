			<h2>Los Angeles Living</h2>
			<p>Los Angeles Real Estate is my everyday grind. It has challenged me to go beyond what I ever thought I was capable of doing. It is truly about mindset and helping people achieve a dream. Los Angeles Real Estate is a hustle and I feel lucky to hustle in this urban paradise.</p>

			<h2>Travel. Lifestyle. Wellness.</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges in my life is finding equilibrium between work, self-care, and fun. Exploring new places and challenging myself to try new things is what grounds me and sets my wild heart free. Welcome to some of my musings, both near and far.</p>

			<h2></h2>
			<p>Home of Portugal’s monarchs, Sintra is a magnificent town of marvelous historic mansions, all set against the backdrop of lush hills. Sintra’s many castles include the Palácio Nacional de Sintra (a main abode of Portuguese royalty until the early 20th century), the hilltop and storybook Palácio da Pena, Quinta de Regaleira (incorporating several architectural styles and with gorgeous surrounding gardens), the Castelo dos Mouros (Moorish Castle), and the Palácio de Monserrate.
